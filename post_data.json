Overall, I prefer how Go forces me to think about errors at every turn. When working in try/catch languages like JavaScript, I often easily forget which functions can throw. Even if I do remember, it&rsquo;s easy to think &ldquo;I think this gets caught somewhere up the call chain&rdquo;.",

I’m not saying that the original idea behind &ldquo;DevOps&rdquo; was perfect - I’ve written about some of the specific issues I&rsquo;ve seen. That said, I think there is enough data and research behind the core ideas by now that there are very few companies willing to admit they don’t &ldquo;do DevOps&rdquo;.",

The process of wrestling my phone number out of their grubby clutches and into control of my new carrier had me raving like a madman by the end of the night. I had a similar experience when trying to quit my local Vasa gym. While I&rsquo;m sure you&rsquo;re familiar with an unnecessarily difficult cancellation process, this might be the first time you&rsquo;ve heard it referred to as a &ldquo;dark pattern&rdquo;.",

Most applications I&rsquo;ve worked on have a RESTful scheme, a GraphQL implementation, or a more strict gRPC system. I&rsquo;ve used REST for the most part, probably just because it&rsquo;s what I&rsquo;m familiar with, but I hate it. Every time I design a new API I can&rsquo;t help but think that it shouldn&rsquo;t be so hard to come up with a sane way to communicate between the server and the client.",
